# SetupShredder

A program that lets you delete installers/setups (or really any files).

Note: This is my first "big" c# project, or really anything that uses the most concepts of c# out of anything ive made.


# How to use

First, download the latest version [here](https://github.com/UGEcko/SetupShredder/releases)

Next, open the program.

Upon opening, you will notice 3 major areas; The directory, the Keywords, and the files list.

The directory is where you define your directory, you are able to type, aswell as browse to find the correct directory, it also comes with a validation element to make sure you are targeting a valid, and proper directory.

Next is Keywords, this is where you add and remove keywords from the main operation, this is technically unlimited, however be wise with how many keywords you enter.

Lastly, there is the files list, this is where you are able to view, aswell as select and do 2 current functions with, go to file, and delete, those should be obvious to what they do.

There is also the options page, where currently you find 2 options; One to log found files to the fileStorage file, and choosing whether or not the file gets permanently deleted or not.

# Finally

How to actually work Setup Shredder:

First choose your directory, you will know its correct or not if the text to the side says invalid, or valid.

Once you choose the directory, head over to the Keywords area, and choose your Keywords.
Setup Shredder already comes with a few default ones that are most common.

To add a new keyword, click on the textbox under Keywords, and type your Keyword in. Next, hit the add button.

To remove a keyword, click on a keyword in the list, and hit the remove button. 

To remove all current keywords, hit Remove All.

And to reset to default, hit the reset button.

If thats it, hit the "Run Setup Shredder" button and await the beautiful response in the files list. Skip the next step if you dont want to bother with options

To Change options, hit the options button under the "Run Setup Shredder" button. To close the panel, hit the Options Button again.

Now, to go to a file, select a file on the file list, and click the "Go to file" button.

To delete a file, select a file, and click delete.
(Change whether or not it perm deletes in options)


Thats about it! Hopefully this helps you out, thank you.

(Also I know this readme is horrible to read, its like 3am)
